            The Origins of Karate in Japan | KCP Japanese Language School
            The exact origins of karate are not known, but it's believed to have developed around 500 years ago. The
            earliest practitioners were members of the royal court who protected the royal family and kept the peace.
            Karate was introduced to mainland Japan in the 1920s by Okinawan karate master Gichin Funakoshi. Funakoshi
            taught a synthesis of Okinawan styles called Shotokan. He dedicated his life to promoting the values of
            karate and introduced it to Japan. In 1949, his followers established the Japan Karate Association (JKA) to
            promote karate.
            Karate is known as heiwa no bu, which means "martial art of peace" in Japanese. It's practiced by more than
            130 million people around the world.
